## Warning: use at your own risk!

* What works for me won't necessarily work for you.  
* Even for me, this repo is (and will probably be forever) a work in progress.  
* I am human, and therefore prone to mistakes.  
* Also, if there is anything in there you don't understand, you probably shouldn't do it.  
* If your computer goes off on its own and starts killing kittens (or whatever it is misbehaved computers do these days), _I will NOT be held resposible_.  

## Aside from that...
